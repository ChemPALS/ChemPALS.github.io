# GitHub Page for the Chemistry Peer Assisted Learning Scheme (PALS) or ChemPALS website

- This page was initially created to simply store links and schedules for activities taking place within ChemPALS.

- This github page is created by [Ian Yang](xyang34@ed.ac.uk), if you require access to the account/page or need assistance on the website, please shoot him an email.

- The URL for the ChemPALS website is [https://chempals.github.io/](https://chempals.github.io/).

- To edit stuff on the website, you need to first have a GitHub account (see this [short video](https://youtu.be/iv8rSLsi1xo?si=YiS2KDkBTtBH635g) on how to use GitHub if you're new!), then request for access to this page. Then, you need to ``git clone`` this repository by typing this command into the command line: ``git clone https://github.com/ChemPALS/ChemPALS.github.io.git`` See [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for a guide on cloning a Git repository. If you need a more comprehensive guide on GitHub or on the use of the command line, check out [BPSM](https://bioinfmsc8.bio.ed.ac.uk/BPSM04.html), which is a beginner programming class for MSc Bioinformatics students. You need a [University of Edinburgh VPN](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/vpn) to access the page.
